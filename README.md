> **Windows Server 2022** was installed on **VMware Workstation Pro** and renamed to `DC01`. A static IP address of `192.168.0.1` was assigned to ensure consistent domain services operation.

<img width="1022" height="728" alt="image004" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a904bf3-901c-4026-9368-86cd2d7902c9" />

> From the **Server Manager Dashboard**, I selected "**Add roles and features**" to begin installing essential server roles, including **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**, **DNS**, and **DHCP**. This launched the **Add Roles and Features Wizard**, a step-by-step interface for configuring server functionality.

<img width="856" height="626" alt="image005" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb99c0e-35f1-43b4-85b6-2e256037c799" />

> I launched the **Add Roles and Features Wizard** and confirmed that the required prerequisites were in place‚Äîstrong administrator password, static IP configuration, and up-to-date patches. After verifying, I proceeded by clicking **Next** to begin the role-based installation process.

<img width="786" height="560" alt="image006" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e413eaf-04dd-455f-a992-9e5b105c91c2" />

> I selected "**Role-based or feature-based installation**", which allows configuring this specific server (DC01) by adding individual roles such as **AD DS**, **DNS**, and **DHCP**. This is the most common option for building a traditional on-premises domain controller in a Windows Server environment.

<img width="786" height="560" alt="image007" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf598ee-c076-4d8a-a56a-b0102b6542c9" />

> In the **Server Selection** step, I verified that `DC01` (IP: `192.168.0.1`) was listed in the **Server Pool** and selected it to proceed with the role installations.

<img width="787" height="558" alt="image008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0e915a-584a-4339-8864-64c84f2c935c" />

> I selected **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** to install.  
> This role enables the server to function as a **domain controller**, managing authentication and authorization for users, computers, and resources in the ITRay environment.  
> AD DS allows centralized identity and access management with single sign-on across the domain.

<img width="785" height="556" alt="image009" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b8fa09-b4de-4dd0-9dfc-02db5e06dec9" />

> After selecting **Active Directory Domain Services**, I was prompted to install additional management tools required for AD DS.  
> I clicked **"Add Features"** to include tools such as:
> - Group Policy Management
> - AD DS Snap-Ins and Command-Line Tools
> - Active Directory Administrative Center
> - PowerShell modules for AD management  
> These tools are essential for configuring, managing, and troubleshooting Active Directory in a domain environment.

<img width="787" height="559" alt="image010" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28cb0a36-2843-44b2-a18d-cc9f8c7b7d88" />

> On the **Select Features** screen, I left all options at their defaults.  
> The necessary features for AD DS‚Äîsuch as **Group Policy Management**‚Äîwere already selected automatically.  
> I clicked **Next** to proceed to the AD DS configuration step.

<img width="785" height="557" alt="image011" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b195e31c-5b70-4682-b6d7-649a666916ea" />

> The final confirmation screen lists all the roles and features selected for installation, including:
> - Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
> - Group Policy Management
> - Remote Server Administration Tools  
> 
> In a **production environment**, it‚Äôs recommended to enable automatic restart after role installation.  
> However, since this is a **lab environment**, a restart is not required at this stage.  
> I proceeded by clicking **Install** to begin the installation process.

<img width="784" height="561" alt="image012" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d483ecff-cf9e-4579-93c4-45a3dacd90c3" />
<img width="1024" height="729" alt="image013" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1424cee-f1e4-4024-ac35-98f72ed08a82" />

> Once the role installation completed successfully, a **post-deployment configuration** prompt appeared in Server Manager.  
> I clicked **"Promote this server to a domain controller"** to begin the Active Directory Domain Services configuration and promote `DC01` into a domain controller for the new forest.

<img width="762" height="560" alt="image014" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a6bd84-e742-483d-b12f-8091ffeb8fef" />

> I chose **"Add a new forest"** to create a brand new Active Directory environment for the lab.  
> Following best practices for domain naming conventions, I specified the **root domain name** as `int.itray.com`:  
> - `itray.com` simulates a registered external namespace  
> - `int` is prepended to distinguish this as an **internal** domain  
> This approach avoids conflicts with public domains while maintaining proper structure.

<img width="762" height="561" alt="image015" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d101c1-f7fa-4489-87ca-0c00e6487eb6" />

> I selected **Windows Server 2016** as the forest and domain functional level for compatibility with modern features.  
> The following default domain controller capabilities were enabled:
> - **Domain Name System (DNS) server**
> - **Global Catalog (GC)**
> 
> I also set a secure **Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)** password.  
> This password is used for recovery scenarios and accessing the domain controller in **Directory Services Repair Mode**.

<img width="764" height="562" alt="image016" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b78bab77-dfd0-4a93-aa4c-68ac8e6ded15" />

> I left **"Create DNS delegation"** unchecked.  
> The warning indicates that a delegation cannot be created because the authoritative parent zone for `itray.com` does not exist‚Äîthis is expected in a lab environment without a public-facing DNS hierarchy.  
> Since **DNS will be installed locally** on this domain controller (`DC01`), delegation is unnecessary. I clicked **Next** to continue.

<img width="760" height="557" alt="image017" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45000a19-3e5f-4bff-b689-0c78a41bc66e" />
<img width="761" height="559" alt="image018" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f28c1890-d8ea-4cbb-aac0-3e21c2f89b47" />

> The setup wizard automatically suggested a **NetBIOS domain name** of `INT`, based on the internal domain `int.itray.com`.  
> However, since the **NetBIOS name is visible to users** when signing in (e.g., `ITRay\username`), I updated it to `ITRay` for a more professional and intuitive experience.

<img width="762" height="561" alt="image019" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1d59b02-3cf2-4cea-8aeb-f9ce63b8d03a" />

> All **prerequisite checks passed successfully**, confirming the system is ready to promote the server to a domain controller.  
> While a few warnings were shown (related to DNS delegation and legacy cryptographic settings), these are expected in a lab environment and do not require action.
> 
> I proceeded by clicking **Install**, which triggered the installation of Active Directory Domain Services and automatically restarted the machine upon completion.

<img width="461" height="575" alt="image020" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c4cb9e8-4fdd-4ac2-aa76-bca2a0415c42" />

> After the reboot, the login screen now displays the domain name **`ITRay`**, confirming that the domain controller was successfully promoted.  
> Domain users can now sign in using the format:  
> - `ITRay\username` or `username@int.itray.com`  
> This verifies that the NetBIOS name and domain configuration were correctly applied during setup.

<img width="1025" height="633" alt="image021" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318b59cd-408b-43dd-9f42-98a3bc175089" />

> After promotion and reboot, **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** and **DNS Server** are now listed in the left-hand panel of **Server Manager**.  
> This confirms that the server `DC01` has been successfully configured with both roles, and is now operating as a domain controller with integrated DNS services.

<img width="1025" height="725" alt="image022" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7e069c7-ed20-414c-b20f-6f2e6d2d5e08" />

> On the **Local Server** properties page in Server Manager, we can now confirm that the system is joined to the domain **`int.itray.com`**, replacing the default `WORKGROUP` setting.  
> This validates that the domain controller promotion was successful and that the machine is now part of the newly established Active Directory environment.

<img width="1028" height="725" alt="image023" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8b198e-63b7-40e2-9fcf-3b1c54810e74" />

> From **Server Manager**, I navigated to the **Tools** menu and selected **DNS** to open the DNS Manager.  
> This interface allows for configuring forward and reverse lookup zones, managing records, and ensuring name resolution works properly in the newly promoted domain `int.itray.com`.

<img width="1022" height="727" alt="image024" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63d06ecc-4677-464e-a46c-be7a09f68b0f" />

> Inside **DNS Manager**, under **Forward Lookup Zones ‚Üí int.itray.com**, we can confirm that the domain controller `DC01` has been automatically registered.  
> The following DNS records are present:
> - **Start of Authority (SOA)** and **Name Server (NS)** records pointing to `dc01.int.itray.com`
> - Two **Host (A)** records for `dc01` resolving to `192.168.0.1`  
> These records validate that the domain controller is discoverable within the network and ready for domain-joined clients to resolve.

<img width="1025" height="725" alt="image025" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f63c9b3f-4f33-4fc0-8241-2b299348c2f0" />
<img width="1024" height="729" alt="image026" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301c6c2-9401-4695-a35e-c8e6243b8b71" />

> I right-clicked the **Start of Authority (SOA)** record under the `int.itray.com` forward lookup zone and selected **Properties**.  
> This opens advanced configuration options for the zone, including:
> - TTL values
> - Primary server settings
> - Serial number and refresh intervals  
> These settings are typically left at defaults in lab environments but can be tuned for performance and replication in production domains.

<img width="1024" height="800" alt="image027" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d190f2-0b25-43a4-8fa5-eb5d40d80708" />

> Under the **Name Servers** tab of the `int.itray.com` DNS zone properties, I verified that the name server entry is properly configured.  
> The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) `dc01.int.itray.com` correctly resolves to the internal IP `192.168.0.1`, confirming that:
> - The domain controller is properly listed as an authoritative name server
> - DNS records are valid and functional for internal resolution  
> This step is key for ensuring reliable DNS queries within the Active Directory environment.

<img width="1019" height="653" alt="image028" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e7a76d-566d-458e-a2cf-38cae9780930" />

> Inside the **Edit Name Server Record** window, I verified that the **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)** `dc01.int.itray.com` is correctly associated with the IP address `192.168.0.1`.  
> The green checkmark and **‚ÄúValidated: OK‚Äù** status confirm that DNS resolution is functional and the entry is fully operational.  
> This ensures reliable name resolution for all domain-joined systems within the network.

<img width="1021" height="724" alt="image029" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/541a17dd-5e08-4138-a4b7-798e56d34d46" />

> I noticed that **Reverse Lookup Zones** had not been configured yet in DNS Manager.  
> Reverse zones are important for resolving IP addresses back to hostnames (PTR records), which is often required for diagnostics and authentication.
> 
> To begin, I right-clicked **Reverse Lookup Zones** and selected **New Zone...**, launching the **New Zone Wizard**. I then clicked **Next** to proceed with the setup.

<img width="763" height="531" alt="image031" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efd2a104-c9f1-4804-8289-920e6f115b9b" />

> I selected **Primary zone**, which allows the zone to be updated directly on this DNS server.  
> This option is ideal for lab environments and standalone domain controllers where DNS is managed locally.
> 
> I left **‚ÄúStore the zone in Active Directory‚Äù** checked, ensuring that the reverse zone is integrated with AD for replication across domain controllers.  
> After confirming the selection, I clicked **Next** to continue.

<img width="1022" height="723" alt="image032" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932afb9e-3e2c-41c5-811b-508ff40cb2e9" />

> I selected the option to replicate the reverse lookup zone to **‚ÄúAll DNS servers running on domain controllers in this domain: int.itray.com‚Äù**.  
> This ensures that if additional domain controllers are introduced within the domain, they will receive a copy of this zone automatically‚Äîenhancing **fault tolerance** and **DNS availability** across the environment.

<img width="758" height="532" alt="image033" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3810b7bc-7130-4283-8b61-571bb5c2730f" />

> I selected **"IPv4 Reverse Lookup Zone"** since my network is based on IPv4 addressing (e.g., `192.168.0.x`).  
> This type of zone allows DNS to resolve IP addresses back into hostnames‚Äîessential for tools like `nslookup` and for validating name resolution across the network.

<img width="759" height="533" alt="image034" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48da6e3b-c32f-44e2-a1c7-6a8b85833768" />

> I set the **Network ID to `192.168.0`**, which defines the range of IP addresses for reverse lookups within this zone.  
> This ensures that as machines (clients, servers, etc.) are added to Active Directory, **reverse DNS records (PTR)** will be automatically created in this zone to support IP-to-hostname resolution.

<img width="755" height="533" alt="image035" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a51629e6-2142-4894-a708-e95406d1e1d1" />

> Successfully created a **Reverse Lookup Zone**:
>
> - **Name**: `0.168.192.in-addr.arpa`
> - **Type**: Active Directory-Integrated Primary
> - **Lookup Type**: Reverse
>
> This enables **PTR record creation** for reverse DNS resolution. You can now verify name resolution with tools like `nslookup` to ensure dynamic updates occur as machines join the domain.

<img width="757" height="530" alt="image036" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/156ee406-525e-4a63-abc7-1dc06af3014f" />
